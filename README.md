"SecureWin"- Lottery Management System is the project we have done as part of mini project in semester 6.

Abstract:
    Our innovative project aims to revolutionize the lottery system in Kerala by introducing
 a secure and transparent process that addresses issues such as fraud, lack of winner
 acknowledgment, and the misuse of lottery winnings. We propose the development of a
 blockchain based application to be used exclusively by lottery sellers and can be used by
 the buyers, ensuring a streamlined and accountable process. The system requires every
 lottery seller to have a dedicated mobile application, allowing them to record information
 of lottery buyers through the application and mapping it with the ticket they brought.
 An OTP will be sent to the buyers mobile number, given at the time of purchase for
 verification. However, the seller will have no access to these details, preventing any
 potential misuse. In the current system, lottery winners often miss claiming their prize
 due to a lack of awareness or fraudulent activities involving black money. Our solution
 tackles this problem by implementing a notification feature. After the lottery results are
 published, the system will automatically alert winners, ensuring they are informed of their
 success. To combat fraud, our system empowers treasury or bank officials to search for
 winners using their ticket numbers. If a winner fails to volunteer within a specified time
 frame, officials can proactively identify and locate the rightful winners, thereby preventing
 fraudulent activities, especially those involving black money. The applicationâ€™s design
 restricts access to buyer information, allowing only officials to view the details during and
 after the day of result publication. In summary, our project enhances the overall lottery
 experience in Kerala by introducing a secure and transparent system.
